My goals are;

To be hero from zero as all programmer want to be. Nothing coming easyl and can not ask food on table.Everthing has a price, 
a value which is money can not buy it.I want to see my own success after my endeavor to be motivated for my future. I want to see that
end of the day everyone wins. I want to see that your intense interest, your expectation from us, your self-sacrifice built on the 
foundations of volunteering you are trying to give us are working. I want to be a person who adds value to the world with what 
he has learned and transfers these values to others.
